  "readme": "# n\n\n My own flavour of node binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install -g n\n\nor\n\n    $ make install\n\n### Installing Binaries\n\nInstall a few nodes (\"v\" is optional), the version given becomes the active node binary once installation is complete.\n\n    $ n 0.2.6\n    $ n v0.3.3\n\nList installed binaries:\n\n    $ n\n\n      0.2.5\n    ο 0.2.6\n      0.3.3\n\nPass some config flags to _./configure_:\n\n    $ n 0.2.6 --debug\n\nList installed binaries, config flags are shown:\n\n      0.2.3\n    ο 0.2.6 --debug\n      0.3.4\n      0.3.5\n\nUse or install the latest official release:\n\n    $ n latest\n\nUse or install the stable official release:\n\n    $ n stable\n\nInstall a custom or patched version of node from a tarball:\n\n    $ n custom 0.6.5 https://github.com/dshaw/node/tarball/patch/v0.6.5status\n\n### Removing Binaries\n\nRemove some versions:\n\n    $ n rm 0.2.4 v0.3.0\n\nInstead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:\n\n    $ n - 0.2.4\n\n### Binary Usage\n\nWhen running multiple versions of node, we can target\nthem directly by asking `n` for the binary path:\n\n    $ n bin 0.3.3\n    /usr/local/n/versions/0.3.3/bin/node\n\nExecute a script with 0.3.3 regardless of the active version:\n\n    $ n use 0.3.3 some.js\n\nwith flags:\n\n    $ n as 0.3.3 --debug some.js\n\nExecute npm with 0.6.3 regardless of the active version:\n\n    $ n npm 0.6.3 install coffee-script\n    $ n npm 0.6.3 list\n\n## Usage\n\n Output from `n --help`:\n\n     Usage: n [options] [COMMAND] [config]\n\n     Commands:\n\n       n                           Output versions installed\n       n latest [config ...]       Install or activate the latest node release\n       n stable [config ...]       Install or activate the latest stable node release\n       n <version> [config ...]    Install and/or use node <version>\n       n custom <version> <tarball> [config ...]  Install custom node <tarball> with [args ...]\n       n use <version> [args ...]  Execute node <version> with [args ...]\n       n npm <version> [args ...]  Execute npm <version> with [args ...]\n       n bin <version>             Output bin path for <version>\n       n rm <version ...>          Remove the given version(s)\n       n --latest                  Output the latest node version available\n       n --stable                  Output the latest stable node version available\n       n ls                        Output the versions of node available\n\n     Options:\n\n       -V, --version   Output current version of n\n       -h, --help      Display help information\n\n     Aliases:\n\n       -       rm\n       which   bin\n       use     as\n       custom  c\n\n## Details\n\n `n` by default installs node to _/usr/local/n/versions_, from\n which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of node when `n <version>` is invoked again.\n\n Activated nodes are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which of course may be altered via the __N_PREFIX__ environment variable.\n\n To alter where `n` operates simply export __N_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
